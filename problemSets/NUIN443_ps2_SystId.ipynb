The key thing to know here is that simple cells are linear and complex cells are not. Specifically, our simple cell has one linear componenent and the complex cell, two non-linear (quadratic) components that get added to produce a response. After the filter output is calculated, we pass it through a Poisson non-linearity to generate spikes. <br> <br>\n",
